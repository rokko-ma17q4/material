## Exogenous variables

Population growth

$$\dot{L} = n L$$

Technical growth

$$\dot{A} = g A$$

## Consumer Behavior: Objective

Consumers act altruistically. They care not only about 
their own consumption but also about offspring's.

Each individual maximizes the total utility: 

$$\max \int_0^\infty e^{-\rho t} u(c(t)) e^{nt} dt$$

Since there are $L(0)$ consumers at $t = 0$, the economy 
as a whole miximizes the following objective. 

$$\max \int_0^\infty e^{-\rho t} u(c(t)) L(t) dt$$

---

## Consumer Behavior: Budget constraint

Each consumer is subject to the following flow budget constraint:

$$c(t) + \dot{s}(t) = \left(r(t) - n\right) s(t)  + w(t)$$

We have $-n s(t)$ in the interest term because of the population growth. Per-person 
share of the interest income is reduced by the factor of growth rate.

## Consumer Behavior: First-order condition

The representative consumer solves the following maximization problem:

$$\max \int_0^\infty e^{-(\rho - n) t} u(c(t)) dt$$
subject to 

$$c(t) + \dot{s}(t) = \left(r(t) - n\right) s(t)  + w(t)$$


**Problem: Set up the Hamiltonian. (3min)**

## Consumer Behavior: Canonical Equations

$$\mathcal H =
e^{-(\rho - n) t} u(c) + \lambda [(r - n) s + w - c]$$


**Problem: Compute the canonical equations. (5min)**

1. $\partial \mathcal H / \partial c = 0$
2. $\dot{\lambda} = - \partial \mathcal H / \partial s$
3. $\dot{s} = \partial \mathcal H / \partial \lambda$

---

## Consumer Behavior: Euler equation

**Problem: Derive the Euler equation. (5min)**

$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)} = 
  \frac{r(t) - \rho}{\Theta(c)} 
\end{aligned}$$

Under the assumption of CRRA utility 

$$u(c) = \frac{c^{1 - \theta} - 1}{1 - \theta},\quad \theta > 0$$

the Euler equation is expressed as

$$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)} = 
  \frac{r(t) - \rho}{\theta} 
\end{aligned}$$

---

## Euler equation for $C/(AL)$

Define the consumption per unit of effective labor:

$$\hat{c} = \frac{c}{A} = \frac{C}{AL}$$

Since $A$ grows exogenously with a constant growth rate $g$, 

$$\frac{\dot{\hat{c}}}{\hat{c}} = \frac{\dot{c}(t)}{c(t)} - g$$

We therefore have 

$$\frac{\dot{\hat{c}}}{\hat{c}} =
\frac{r(t) - \rho - \theta g}{\theta}$$

`r section("firms")`

## Firm behavior: Production function

Let's describe the behavior of the firms.

This is mostly equivalent to the setup of the Solow model.

The firms have access to the CRS production technology 

$$Y(t) = F(K(t), A(t) L(t)).$$

In per-$AL$ term,

$$\hat{y}(t) = f\left(\hat{k} (t)\right) = 
\frac{F(K, AL)}{AL}$$


---

## Firm behavior: Profit maximization

Rent

$$r(t) + \delta = f'\left( \hat{k}(t) \right)$$

Wage

$$w(t) = A(t) \left[
  f\left( \hat{k}(t) \right) - k(t) f'\left( \hat{k}(t) \right)
\right]$$

Wage per effective labor

$$\hat{w}(t) = f\left( \hat{k}(t) \right) - k(t) f'\left( \hat{k}(t) \right)$$


---

## Equilibrium: Capital Accumulation

The capital market clearing condition:

$$s(t) L(t) = K(t)$$


The flow budget constraint

$$c(t) + \dot{s}(t) = \left(r(t) - n\right) s(t)  + w(t)$$

is transformed into 

$$\frac{\dot{\hat{k}}}{\hat{k}} =
\frac{\dot s}{s} - g = 
\frac{f\left(\hat{k}\right) - \hat{c} - (\delta + g + n) \hat{k}}{\hat{k}}$$

---

## Equilibrium: First-order Dynamics

We have the following capital accumulation equation:

$$\dot{\hat{k}} = f\left(\hat{k}\right) - \hat{c} - (\delta + g + n) \hat{k}$$

The dynamics of the Ramsey model is determined by this capital 
accumulation equation together with 
the Euler equation:

$$\frac{\dot{\hat{c}}}{\hat{c}} =
\frac{f'\left(\hat{k}\right) - \delta - \rho - \theta g}{\theta}$$
